Lan chat application requirement document


objectives:

1. A nick name to be obtained form the client and used for communication.
2. Broadcast message implementation.
3. Group creation and sending message to that group.
4. Unicast message based on username.
5. List online users in client.


Design:

client to client message communication design

Client1 will get a nick name from user and that to be saved in server (database can be a tree or
list based on the size and number of client in the network).

The client want to send a message to another client, client1 need to specify the nick name of
client2 amd send the message to that client.

Eg:
lanchat clients_nick_name <message> <type>

The type field can be used for broadcast/unicast message

A new terminal will be opened to display the messages intended for client. This will be done using pipe.
